The dataset consists of three main components: customer data, facility data, and scenario data.

1) **Customer Data:** This sheet contains information on individual customers, including their unique customer ID, geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), and the number of visits per year required for each customer.

2) **Facility Data: ** This sheet is divided into existing facilities and potential new facilities. For each facility, the data includes its geographical coordinates, a cost associated with either closing (for existing facilities) or opening (for potential facilities), and the facility's capacity, which indicates how many customer visits it can handle annually.

3) **Scenario Data:** This sheet outlines different scenarios that reflect variations in customer demand and facility capacity. The data is structured to show how demand and capacity might fluctuate under different high, low, and mixed scenarios. Each scenario provides a unique perspective on the demand each customer generates and the capacity each facility can support
